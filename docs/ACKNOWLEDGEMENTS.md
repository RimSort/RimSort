* **[joseasoler](https://github.com/joseasoler)** - For creating [todds](https://github.com/todds-encoder/todds), which makes .dds texture optimization possible in RimSort
* **[Paladin, and his efforts with RimPy](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy)** - If you've been around the RimWorld scene for any amount of time, you've probably heard RimPy at least mentioned. RimSort was built to be a community-oriented, completely FLOSS alternative to RimPy and it's associated workflows.
* **[SteamworksPy](https://github.com/philippj/SteamworksPy)** - Steamworks API is what makes it possible for us to interact with Steam client. This is used by the app, and for DB Builder to make the SteamDB. A lot of things are made possible by this Python module.
* **The entire community!** - You all are why this is possible, so please, keep making great mods and supporting the game! Feel free to join us on the [Discord!](https://discord.gg/aV7g69JmR2)
