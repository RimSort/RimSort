## Development

### Quick Start

#### Introduction

* RimSort is built in Python using the [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/) module, as well as several others. RimSort packaged for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

* For a (mostly automated) experience building RimSort, please execute the provided script:
    * Prerequisites:
        * Linux users need `g++` compiler (just get your distro's build tools - i.e. `build-essential`, etc)
        * MacOS users need Xcode command line tools
        * Windows users need to install VS build tools
        * See [Building SteamworksPy from Source](https://github.com/oceancabbage/RimSort/wiki/Development-Guide#building-steamworkspy-from-source) for supplemental information regarding this.
    * Run `python3 distribute.py`
        * This will build RimSort for your platform and output a build for your platform (Including all requirements and submodules)

### Manually building

* RimSort also depends on the following submodules (run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initiate/update):
    * [steamfiles](https://github.com/twstagg/steamfiles): used to parse Steam client acf/appinfo/manifest information
    * [SteamworksPy](https://github.com/philippj/SteamworksPy): used for interactions with the local Steam client
        * SteamworksPy is a python module built to interface directly with the [Steamworks API](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api)
        * This allows certain interactions with the local Steam client to be initiated through the Steamworks API via Python (such as subscribing/unsubscribing to/from Steam mods via RimSort)

#### Setting up Python & dependencies

* RimSort uses Python, and depends on several Python modules:
    * [Python](https://www.python.org/): programming language used to develop RimSort. Install version `3.9.6` if possible. You can do this by first installing [HomeBrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) and then running `brew install python@3.9`.
    * [natsort](https://pypi.org/project/natsort/): used for "naturally sorting" lists of folders
    * [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/): packages application for distribution. Install version >= `1.6-4c6` if possible. You can do this by running `pip3 install nuitka`.
        * [This issue](https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/2154) was fixed in Nuitka 1.6
            * At this time (04/09/2023) you can install with nuitka factory using `pip install -U --force-reinstall "https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/archive/factory.zip"`
    * [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/): GUI toolkit for building the application. Install version `5.15.2.1` if possible. You can do this by running `pip3 install PySide6==6.4.3`.
    * [steam](https://pypi.org/project/steam/): Steam module included to be used for the WebAPI calls in the "Dynamic Query" feature. You can do this by running `pip3 install steam`.
    * [toposort](https://pypi.org/project/toposort/): sort mods! Install version `1.9` if possible. You can do this by running `pip3 install toposort==1.9`.
    * [xmltodict](https://pypi.org/project/xmltodict/): parse RimWorld `xml` files. Install version `0.13.0` if possible. You can do this by running `pip3 install xmltodict==0.13.0`.

* You can install all of the above dependencies by executing the command at the project root: 
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* If you are using a Mac with an Apple M1/M2 CPU, the following instructions also work for i386, if you would rather use MacPorts over Homebrew or another method. Consider the following:
    * `sudo port select --set pip3 pip39`
    * `sudo port select --set python3 python39`

* Mac users should also keep in mind that Apple has it's own Runtime Protection called [Gatekeeper](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/gatekeeper-and-runtime-protection-sec5599b66df/web)
    * This can cause issues when trying to run RimSort (or execute dependent libs)!
    * You can circumvent this issue by using `xattr` command to manually whitelist:
        * `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine RimSort.app`
        * `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine libsteam_api.dylib`

#### Setting up steamfiles module

* You can setup this module using the following commands:
    * `cd steamfiles`
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Using SteamworksPy binaries:

* You can setup this module using the following commands:
    * `cd SteamworksPy`
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* For RimSort to actually USE the SteamworksPy module, you need the compiled library for your platform, as well as the binaries from the steamworks SDK in the RimSort project root - in conjunction the python module included at: `SteamworksPy/steamworks`.
    * Repo maintainers will provide pre-built binaries for the `SteamworksPy` library, as well as the redistributables from the steamworks-sdk in-repo as well as in in each platform's respective Release.
    * On Linux, you will want to copy `SteamworksPy_*.so` (where * is your CPU) to `SteamworksPy.so`
    * On MacOS, you will want to copy `SteamworksPy_*.dylib` (where * is your CPU) to `SteamworksPy.dylib`

#### Building SteamworksPy from source:

This is an _**OPTIONAL**_ step. You do not _**NEED**_ to do this - there are already pre-built binaries available for usage in-repo as well as in each platform's respective Release. Please do not attempt to commit/PR an update for these binaries without maintainer consent - these will not be approved otherwise.

Reference: https://philippj.github.io/SteamworksPy/

* On Linux, you need `g++'. It worked right out of the box for me on Ubuntu.
    * Just run the included script: `python3 distribute.py`
        * OR see the commands I use to compile it automatically using the script

* On MacOS, you need Xcode command line tools. Then, you can compile directly with the script (without a full Xcode install):
    * Just run the included script: `python3 distribute.py`
        * OR see the commands I use to compile it automatically using the script

* On Windows, you need to get Visual Studio & Build Tools for Visual Studio:
    * https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022
        * When you run the downloaded executable, it updates and runs the Visual Studio Installer. To install only the tools you need for C++ development, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload. Alternatively, just install VS Community 2022 with the standard loadset.
        * Just run the included script: `python3 distribute.py`
            * OR see the commands I use to compile it automatically using the script

#### Texture optimization (todds)
* RimSort uses [todds](https://github.com/joseasoler/todds) as a dependency for texture optimization. It is shipped with RimSort, archived into the binary releases. If you are building/running from source, you will want to place a todds binary at `./todds/todds` (for Linux/Mac) OR `.\todds\todds.exe` (for Windows)
* You can run `distribute.py` and this is automatically taken care of you if you are building on a supported platform
    * You need to enable this first. Edit the script and remove the comment for string `build_steamworkspy()`

#### Running RimSort from source
1. Clone this repository to a local directory.
2. Ensure you have completed the prerequisite steps above.
3. From the project root, execute `python3 RimSort.py`

#### Packaging RimSort

1. First, clone this repository to a local directory.
2. Packaging with `nuitka`:
    - Follow the prerequisite setup instructions, and then run `python distribute.py`
    - Alternatively, see the commands used by platform in the aforementioned script. 

#### Developing Features

Please discuss with maintainers first, but we are tracking features and issues related to RimSort in the Github repo's "Issues" tab

#### Misc Coding Style

* The preferred Python formatter is: black (`pip3 install black`)
    * Here is a nice little article for VSCode: https://dev.to/adamlombard/how-to-use-the-black-python-code-formatter-in-vscode-3lo0
* The preferred Docstring format is: [Sphinx reST](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)
* Type annotations should be added to function/method signatures
* We use [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for static type checking.
    * Grab [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matangover.mypy) for VSCode/VSCodium!
* Autoflake is also really nice!
    * Grab [this extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/mikoz/autoflake-extension) for VSCode/VSCodium
    * Set it up like such: https://stackoverflow.com/a/67941822
* For quick setup, you can install some of the dependencies described above to automate your development:
    * `pip install -r requirements_develop.txt`

#### Misc information

* On MacOS, to see open sockets, use: `netstat -anvp tcp | awk 'NR<3 || /LISTEN/'`
