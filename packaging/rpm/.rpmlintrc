# rpmlint configuration for rimsort

# This package uses Nuitka to create a standalone binary with all dependencies bundled.
# As a result, it triggers several warnings that are expected and acceptable for this
# packaging approach.

# Bundled shared libraries are expected in Nuitka standalone builds
addFilter("E: shlib-policy-name-error")

# Bundled libraries may call exit() directly
addFilter("W: shared-lib-calls-exit")

# Nuitka binaries are not stripped (preserves debugging capabilities)
addFilter("W: unstripped-binary-or-object")

# Large binary size (~700MB) is expected due to bundled Qt6, Python runtime, and dependencies
addFilter("W: file-size-mismatch")

# The application binary is installed in /usr/share (via wrapper) which is intentional
addFilter("W: arch-dependent-file-in-usr-share")

# Package doesn't use standard %{_libdir} because everything is bundled
addFilter("W: library-not-linked-against-libc")

# Python bytecode is bundled by Nuitka, not installed separately
addFilter("W: python-bytecode-without-source")
