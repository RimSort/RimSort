![RimSort Preview](./docs/rimsort_preview.png)

RimSort is an **open source** mod manager for the video game [RimWorld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/). There is support for Linux, Mac, and Windows, built from the ground up to be a reliable, community-managed alternative to [RimPy Mod Manager](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy/releases).

To run RimSort, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/oceancabbage/RimSort/releases) page and download the latest zipped release for your operating system. For Windows and Linux, unzip the download and run the `RimSort` executable inside the unzipped folder. For MacOS, make sure you grab the appropriate release per your CPU (i386 is for an Intel CPU Mac, arm is for an Apple M1/M2 CPU Mac). Once downloaded + extracted, run the `.app` directly.

Bugs and feature requests are tracked in the [Issues](https://github.com/oceancabbage/RimSort/issues) section of this repo. If you run into a bug or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an Issue here yourself!
